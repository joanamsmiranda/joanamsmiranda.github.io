        <h2 id="what-visit-vietnam">what to visit?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="visit"><strong>Halong Bay</strong></li><br>
            <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/beach-sunset.png" alt="photo of Halong Bay" width="500" height="300">
            <p>The karst seascape of Halong Bay is one of the world's most spellbinding sea views and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Thousands of limestone islands sit within this bay in the Gulf of Tonkin, eroded into jagged pinnacles by wind and water action over millennia. With the bay's scenery best seen by boat, this is prime cruising territory. Opt for at least an overnight tour to see Halong Bay's iconic views as a day trip doesn't do it justice.</p>
        <li class="visit"><strong>Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park</strong></li><br>
<img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/mountains-and-lake.png" alt="photo of Phong nha's national park" width="500" height="300">
            <p>One of the world's best caving destinations, World Heritage-listed Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park is a dramatic karst mountain formation honeycombed with huge caverns, which are home to superb stalactite and stalagmite displays. The most popular destination within the park is the Paradise Cave, which extends for a staggering 31 kilometers below ground.</p>
            <li class="visit"><strong>Ho Chi Minh City</strong></li><br>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Skyscrapers_of_Shinjuku_2009_January_%28revised%29.jpg" alt="photo of Ho Chi Minh City" width="500" height="300">
            <p>The streets are an insane clog of motorbikes and cars, the restaurant and cafe scene is incredibly cosmopolitan, and the shopping is the best you'll find in the country. At its center is Dong Khoi, a relatively small and easily navigable central district, which holds most of the city's sights.</p>
